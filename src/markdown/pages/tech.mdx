## Our Mission

We choose to work at The New York Times because we care deeply about our mission. The same values that brought us here — integrity, respect and collaboration — compel us to organize.

We believe that a vibrant and healthy workplace is not only compatible with our mission, it is essential to it. To truly uphold the ideals The Times espouses, to make “society stronger and more just,” we must champion them with the same tenacity and dedication in practice as we do on the page. By forming a union, we can address some of our most pressing issues:

**We strive for excellence**, but recognize that it is predicated on fairness and transparency around compensation. Excellence also comes over time: it is built through clear, equitable promotion processes.

**We strive for a curious and collaborative work environment**, but understand that can only be achieved through independence, as well as clear roles and responsibilities.

**We strive for a workplace characterized by integrity and respect**, one that is diverse, representative, and equitable. One enriched by a plurality of voices.

Forming a union empowers us to pursue these goals, and allows us to stand with our peers where they have previously stood alone.

We already have 1,300+ colleagues in the NewsGuild at The Times. We’re proud and excited to join them and thousands of other tech workers, who are standing up for themselves like never before.

<FAQ>
  <FAQItem question="What is a union?">
    <p>Our <strong>union</strong> is a democratic community of workers coming together to improve our working conditions and benefits. Once our union is recognized, we will have the right to bargain for a contract, called a <strong>collective bargaining agreement</strong>, that will hold management accountable for things like pay equity, diversity and job security.</p>
<p>Collectively, we are the union, and we decide what’s best for us.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="Why are we organizing?">
    <p>We have more power and leverage together than we do as individuals. Through a union, we can negotiate a legally binding contract that spells out our working conditions for all to see, and to which the company must adhere.</p>
<p>Without a union or a contract, our employer can unilaterally change our working conditions or fire us at any time, without cause. Our employer also has no legal obligation to respond to at-will employees’ feedback and concerns.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="Why join the NewsGuild?">
    <p><a href="https://www.nyguild.org/">The NewsGuild of New York</a> represents over 3,000 media workers, including our colleagues in the newsroom, security, TimesCenter, parts of advertising, and other departments — totalling over 1,300 Times employees. The NewsGuild international is also the largest union for news professionals in the country, representing over 20,000 journalists, media workers, and other workers.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="Is there a difference between the existing Times Union and the Tech Union?">
    <p>The existing Times Guild includes over 1,300 Times employees from departments across the company. As the tech workers of The New York Times, we are thrilled to join our coworkers in solidarity by becoming members of the same union — the NewsGuild of New York.</p>
<p>We will stand in solidarity with the Times Guild during their contract negotiations, however, in order to address the unique issues that we face as tech workers, we decided to bargain our own separate contract and form an independent unit within the NewsGuild of New York.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="Who is eligible for the union?">
    <p>All non-managerial employees in engineering, product management, project management, design, QA, and data analysis whose primary work location is in the United States are eligible for our bargaining unit.</p>
<p><strong>If you aren't a part of these groups and would like to form a union as well, please <a href="mailto:nyttech@nyguild.org">reach out to us</a>!</strong> We'll support you in every way we can.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="Can managers join the union?">
    <p>Managers are <strong>ineligible</strong> to join our union under the National Labor Relations Act.</p>
<p>This eligibility is not based on job title, but on power and responsibility. By law, managers must have at least some of the following responsibilities: hiring, firing, evaluating, approving schedules and time off, and the ability to promote, discipline, or transfer other employees.</p>
<p>For instance, an Analytics Manager may have “manager” in their title, but if they have no direct reports nor ability to fire or hire employees, they are eligible to join a union.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="What will we be bargaining for?">
    <p>That’s up to all of us! After we are recognized, we will elect our unit leadership, who will send surveys, talk with every colleague, and hold meetings to discuss bargaining priorities. Everyone will have the opportunity to impact the bargaining process, and the more voices heard, the stronger our union will be.</p>
<p>Here is a brief, non-exhaustive list of what we can bargain for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salary transparency, minimum salaries for each role, and equitable compensation.</li>
<li>Standards for career growth, hiring, and promotion processes. </li>
<li>Access to company data on recruitment, promotion, and retention of underrepresented groups.</li>
<li>Increased accessibility support for coworkers with disabilities.</li>
<li>Just cause protections against discipline or firing without reason.</li>
<li>Mandated severance benefits and notice for layoffs.</li>
<li>A pension plan, on-call compensation, overtime pay, and reduced healthcare costs.</li>
<li>Consistent remote/work-from-home policies.</li>
</ul>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="How can we fight for diversity and inclusion through a union?">
    <p>We want our union to be a force for making our workplace as inclusive as possible. That means creating an environment where our most marginalized colleagues feel supported, are equitably compensated for their work and have opportunities for long, rewarding careers at The Times.</p>
<p>With a union, we will have the legal right to request and receive data on hiring, compensation, retention and performance from our employer. This will allow us to detect patterns and disparities in employee treatment, as Times Guild members have done for <a href="/papers/2021-04-11-pay-disparities">employee compensation</a> and <a href="/papers/2021-02-28-perf-eval-bias">performance evaluations</a>, and to propose contractual solutions to remedy those disparities.</p>
<p>In our contract, we can also push for provisions to hold management accountable to their diversity commitments—like requiring that a minimum percentage of candidates for open roles come from underrepresented backgrounds. </p>
<p>All of this will be in partnership and collaboration with the amazing groups we already have working on these issues, like the Women’s Network, Black@NYT and Times Out. We look forward to working in solidarity to put our collective ideas into legally enforceable language.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="How do we secure recognition of our union?">
    <p>A majority of eligible tech workers have already signed union cards voting to form a union. We have asked The Times to voluntarily recognize our union, as The Times did with the Wirecutter Union in 2019. To officially certify our union, a neutral third party would conduct a card check to confirm that we do in fact have a majority of our unit’s support. Once we are certified, status quo will protect our current working conditions and we can begin negotiating our first contract.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="Can we be retaliated against?">
    <p>United States labor law prohibits the company from retaliating against, threatening, or coercing employees due to organizing activity. As an added measure of protection, every member of the Organizing Committee has pledged to stand with anyone affected if The Times were to break the law.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="How will our union work once it is formed?">
    <p>Once we’re recognized, everyone who has signed a card will elect our leaders. A bargaining committee will also be appointed and will negotiate our first contract based on our shared priorities. We will elect shop stewards, who will be trained to represent coworkers, ensure status quo (and eventually our contract) is enforced, and organize around issues that come up in the workplace. The Contract Action Team will be responsible for regular communication between the general membership and our bargaining committee to ensure everyone’s voices are heard in the process.</p>
<p>Guild staff will be there every step of the way to give us training, guidance, legal support and other resources that will ensure we have the tools we need to fight for our priorities and values together.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="I have a good relationship with my manager. Will a union make the workplace more antagonistic?">
    <p>That’s not our goal. We want to make a workplace that’s better for everyone, and many of us have positive relationships with our direct supervisors. Our goal is to create consistent policies that are equitably enforced, so that professional disputes don’t turn into personal conflicts between bosses and subordinates.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="How much are dues?">
    <p>NewsGuild dues are currently 1.3846% of base pay. Our dues ensure we have the resources we need to have a strong union.</p>
<p>Dues cover the cost of bargaining and enforcing contracts, legal fees, training and membership development, office space, and more. Dues also support our fellow NewsGuild members bargaining for their own first contracts, just as other shop’s dues will support us through our own negotiations. We will not pay dues until we have voted to ratify our first contract. NewsGuild of New York members have consistently fought for contracts with raises and benefit improvements that more than offset the cost of dues.</p>
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question="I'm interested! How can I get involved?">
    <p>Great! The best way to get involved is to join one of our membership meetings, where we discuss how to improve our workplace and build a community together. Once we are recognized, you can also get involved as a shop steward, a member of the Contract Action Team, or setting up a union caucus or committee around a specific issue. If you're interested in joining the bargaining committee, please let us know!</p>
