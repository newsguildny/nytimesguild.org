Almost six years ago, I joined The Times after studying digital news media and finding inspiration in the company’s vision. What I have found is a community of passionate, caring, talented people who are frequently underpaid, isolated and marginalized by leadership. I remember beloved coworkers who were forced to leave because they didn’t fit in with the predominantly white monoculture of their team. I remember top leaders recommending the “leave and come back” strategy as a feckless antidote for lackluster career opportunities. I remember my own painful journey of resisting pressure to leave long enough to actually find the people, leaders and teams dreaming of a better NYT. Hence, I am incredibly proud to form this union in solidarity with my past, present and future coworkers. We all deserve a place where our careers and selves can blossom, and we deserve those seats at the table, where we can envision and build these possible futures together.
