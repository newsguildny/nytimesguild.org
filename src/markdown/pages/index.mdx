## About

We are the unionized workers of The New York Times. We are members of different units and work in different fields — journalism, tech, print and security, to name a few — but we share certain fundamental principles about our work.

We choose to work at The New York Times because we care deeply about its mission. The same values that brought us here — integrity, respect and collaboration — are woven into how we want to work together.

We believe that a healthy workplace requires a diverse and inclusive environment where everyone can do their best work. To truly uphold the ideals The Times espouses, to make “society stronger and more just,” we must champion them as part of our workplace conditions with the same tenacity and dedication in practice as we do on the page. By giving power to the workers who write, build, and support the New York Times, our unions we can address some of the most pressing issues in our workplace:

We strive for excellence, but recognize that it is predicated on fairness and transparency around compensation. Staff excellence also comes over time and requires a clear, equitable promotion process.

We strive for a curious and collaborative work environment, but understand with clear roles and responsibilities. Our best work can only be achieved through independence, but that requires respect for our jobs — including job protections from the uncertain creep of Generative AI.

We strive for a workplace characterized by integrity and respect, but know this can only be achieved with policies that aim to ensure equity and inclusion in the workplace.

Solidarity empowers us to pursue these goals, and allows us to stand with our peers where they have previously stood alone.

## Our commitment to DEI

A workplace characterized by integrity and respect — one enriched by a plurality of voices — is not only compatible with our mission, it is essential to it. To truly uphold the ideals The Times espouses, to make “society stronger and more just,” we must champion them with the same tenacity and dedication in practice as we do on the page.

The existing Times Guild of New York and the newly-formed Times Tech Guild have many shared concerns, but one of the most crucial is a clear and sustained commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

A workplace characterized by integrity and respect and enriched by a plurality of voices is essential to our mission. To truly uphold the ideals The Times espouses, to make “society stronger and more just,” we must champion them with the same tenacity and dedication in practice as we do on the page.

The Times must become more diverse. This is not lip service, corporate good citizenship or a favor from management to our BIPOC colleagues. It is core to what The Times must do to broaden its audience and improve how it covers the world. Diversity is how our coverage becomes more comprehensive, more nuanced, more variegated, more vibrant. The leadership of the New York Times has said this, and we agree.

But this transformation requires a sustained commitment from the publisher on down.

It also requires more than listening. For these changes to take hold and be effective, they must come from collaboration across all people at the New York Times, not the pronouncements of consultants and management committees.

Below, you’ll find our open exploration of these profoundly important issues, as well as our recommendations on how we can improve diversity and inclusion at The Times in a meaningful way.
