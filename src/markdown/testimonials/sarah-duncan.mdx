I believe in transparency and fairness. I have loved working at The New York Times for the past 2.5 years and would love to continue to work here, but we need to improve in these areas and have a protected structure for future improvements. The best way I can see that happening is if we band together as workers to vocalize what matters to us, and lend power to that voice through collective bargaining. I am honored to be standing with my colleagues to work towards a better NYT.
