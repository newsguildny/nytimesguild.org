Being able to work for The New York Times is truly one of the best things that has happened to me. I am incredibly proud to work for this company and I know I’m not alone. The entire organizing committee’s dedication to the unionizing effort is a testament to that. We want to stay and make this company the best it can be, and that cannot happen without equity, transparency and the right for all workers to have a say in the workplace.
