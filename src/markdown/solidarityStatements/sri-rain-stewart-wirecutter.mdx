Iâ€™m proud to know that I have certain protections in place now for better pay, improving diversity and inclusion, and more. I want all workers to be treated and compensated fairly, as well as opportunities to grow and excel. Being part of the Guild makes this more attainable, and I want this especially for the Times Tech Guild. We are always stronger when we act together.
