Working at The New York Times for the past 3.5 years has been a truly rewarding experience. I have had the opportunity to work with incredible people on a mission that I, along with my colleagues, care deeply about. The Times has stated that it would like to continually improve on the company as a place to work. In order to best do so I believe that all of us who work here should have a say in how that happens. Organizing will give us the opportunity to help define what a better place to work means and how to get there.
