I believe everyone should have a union, and we at The Times are no exception. With this union, all of my amazing, intelligent coworkers become collaborators in fighting for a better workplace, co-authors of a more inclusive and equitable future for The Times. In organizing this union, we have already created a beautiful and supportive community, and our best work is yet to be done.
