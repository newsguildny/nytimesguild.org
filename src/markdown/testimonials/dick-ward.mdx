I’m proud to work at The New York Times, and I’m constantly amazed by the skill, enthusiasm, and dedication of my coworkers. All of us are committed to the mission of the company and work hard to get The Times where it is, and we deserve a seat at the table when making decisions relating to our working conditions. As a union, we can fight for the things that matter to us: pay equity and transparency, fairness in hiring practices, and equality for workers at the company. Every day I work with amazing people to forward the goals of The New York Times, and I now look forward to working with them to ensure that our workplace is one that represents the workers.
