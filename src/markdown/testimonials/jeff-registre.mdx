As workers, it’s all of us together who create the value company leadership touts. When the year end review comes around, and we hear of the excellent feedback and engagement from users — the out-of-the-world growth in revenue, etc; —  it is indeed all of us workers who create that. Everyone from those who print the papers, secure and clean facilities, make the ads, design the UIs, create the backends, etc; created the tasty value.

And yet, workers don’t participate in — and instead have to live with — the decisions made for the company by management.

Now I must admit, there have been plenty of times where I thought that a union wouldn’t really give us workers much or solve much. But I think now that I was wrong about that. Since workers are the value creators, if all workers stand in solidarity, management must listen, lest they wish to fail the shareholders.

For the past three years I’ve been at The Times, and what I’ve enjoyed the most is the creativity and work of my coworkers who make the amazing products behind The Times, both on my own team and beyond. I’m happy to be here, and I hope this is one part of a much larger drive across the country to undo the last 50 years of damage done to unionization.
