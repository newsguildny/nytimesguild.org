## About

Comprising the editorial and business workers of The New York Times, the
Times-Guild -- represented by The NewsGuild of New York -- has protected and
advanced the interests of its members at the Times since 1940. While The New
York Times continues to lead the media industry with critical and
revolutionary journalism, we remind management that without us, there’s no
story, no platform, and no revenue. Our union continually works to improve the
lives of our members, advocate for transparent and quality editorial standards
and business practices, and fight for a workplace that values, encourages, and
promotes diversity and inclusion. 

We are facing a monumental moment in the Times history -- one that our union
can and should have a direct hand in shaping. As we bargain our next contract,
hold management accountable to their promises of a more diverse Times, and
welcome new members into our Guild, we are stronger than we have ever been.
Together we will ensure that the Times remains the leading storyteller across
the globe, but on our collective terms.

## Guild History at The Times

The Times-Guild has been a critical part of the Times’ since 1940, when
commercial workers voted 418-198 to unionize with the Guild. That breakthrough
was the culmination of years of struggle against management opposition during
which The Times fired or demoted some staff members for union activity. Our
first contract, in 1941, gave members raises, a 40-hour work week, overtime,
holidays, severance pay, maternity leave, and other benefits. Soon after,
Guild contracts were expanded to cover our editorial staff and other
departments, like technology. We’ve faced many arduous battles as a union.
From striking for our pension in 1965 to walking out for our copy editors in
2017, we’ve stood strong for over 81 years.
