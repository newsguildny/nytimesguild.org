## Who We Are

We are the almost 700 tech workers who build and maintain the critical infrastructure behind The New York Times. We are software and QA engineers, designers, data analysts and scientists, project and product managers.

**Our work powers:** <br/>
The journalism you read every day<br/> 
The games you play<br/>
The recipes you cook<br/>
The audio stories you listen to <br/>
Everything from our elections coverage to Wordle<br/>

## What We're Fighting For

We unionized because our members want a collective voice in making The New York Times a great place to work in tech. We care deeply about the work we do and even more so about the welfare of our colleagues. 

**For two years, we've been fighting for our first contract.** This contract has the power to make significant structural improvements that would reduce turnover and ensure we have the resources we need to continue doing our jobs well. 

We're Fighting For:

* **Job security,** including just cause with no exceptions, to promote fairness and foster an environment with safeguards against bias and abuse of power. 

* **Fair hours, wages, and benefits,** to attract and retain the best talent, and establish equitable conditions where all workers can thrive.

* **Diversity, Equity & Inclusion** The products we build inform, entertain, and tell the stories of people from all walks of life. In order to ensure their accessibility and relevance, we need a workforce that reflects the broad range of stories we tell.

## What We're Up Against

Although it's been over two years since we won our union election, **management is still not bargaining in good faith.** 

The company continues to make unlawful changes to our working conditions, has fired colleagues without good cause, and uses delay tactics like limiting bargaining time and refusing to give us information that's necessary to engage in productive bargaining. 

### Company Success and Stock Buybacks

As of December 31, 2023, The New York Times Company had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of **approximately $709 million and was debt-free.**

What is The New York Times doing with its profits?

Since our unit was recognized, the company has spent $170.5 million in stock buybacks, creating a windfall for New York Times executives and shareholders on Wall Street. The company has already authorized an additional $229.5 million in stock buybacks and says that it **aims to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders** in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next three to five years. 

$400 million authorized for stock buybacks but no contract for the workers that have generated those profits? 

We see what the company's priorities areâ€¦ 

## How You Can Support Us

While management has been stalling, we've been organizing. Our members are ready to do whatever it takes to win the contract we deserve, one that sets new standards for the industry. 

**We need your support!**
