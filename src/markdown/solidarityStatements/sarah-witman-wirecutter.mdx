I've been a Guild member for about two years, and it has been immensely rewarding and empowering to see my colleagues come together to challenge the status quo and create a work environment that is safe, supportive, energetic, effective, and meaningful for all of us. I have never once felt alone or vulnerable throughout our actions over the past few years, whether we were collectively sending emails or slack messages, striking, or negotiating at the bargaining table. I feel grateful to be part of such a strong unit, and proud of all that we've been able to accomplish.
