I have been a member of the Guild for 6 years, across two news outlets. Having been at one of the news outlets before it unionized, I can say unequivocally that being a union member has only made my life better. I am about to have my first child, and because of Guild organizing Reuters will be giving me a total of 18 weeks paid time off to be with him.
