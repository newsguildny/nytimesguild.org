My colleagues and I care deeply for The Times's mission, and it's clear to me that supporting the mission implies supporting each other. I look forward to protecting the positive aspects of our current working conditions and fighting to improve the areas where we could do better. I've been so inspired by my thoughtful and caring colleagues, and I'm so excited to see what we can do together.
