Iâ€™m proud to be a Guild member because when we fight, we win! And every time we do it, we make it easier for every other worker who comes after us to do the same. Wirecutter Union took on the same management (with your support!) and won, and I am so excited for it to be your turn. NYT management has proven repeatedly that they're not willing to do it, so let's make this a better place to work together.
