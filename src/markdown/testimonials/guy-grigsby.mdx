I love my job. I have always dreamed of working for The New York Times. I know, however, that there are people who are not treated equitably. White women and people of color, especially Black women, are not treated as I am. Where I would be called assertive and confident, they are seen as aggressive, and when negotiating for a salary, I am given the benefit of the doubt. Our collective voice will increase transparency in pay and give us the ability to detect and start to remedy trends in differing treatment between the stereotypical “tech worker” and those who do not look like me. I hope that everyone can love working at The Times as much as I do and be treated with the same respect.
