## A legacy of labor

The New York Times mission is made possible by many different unions who work in everything from the newsroom, security, printing presses, delivery trucks, and technology with thousands of combined members! While we all belong to different units, the New York Times doesn’t work without us. The Times Tech Guild is a new unit within the Times-Guild of New York. Together, we honor and build on the long and proud history of our colleagues fighting to build inclusive work practices.

## A history of labor & solidarity at The Times

- 2025: The Times Tech Guild wins their first contract. This guaranteed just-cause before disciplining or firing employees, salary floors for new hires, guaranteed annual raises, and many other other member benefits.

- 2024: The Times Tech Guild goes on strike during the US presidential elections. A super majority of members voted for the strike. During the strike, workers called for a boycott of Games and Cooking and built an alternative site for reader solidarity.

- 2023: The Times Tech Guild walkout due to unfair labor practices. Workers walked out after New York Times Management tried to intimidate workers to return to the office or receive low performance ratings and affect pay increases.


- 2022: The Times Guild holds a one day walk-out over stagnant wages, discriminatory performance practices, and return-to-work conditions.


- 2022: The Times Tech Guild wins their union certification vote 404 - 88. The Times Tech Guild is the largest US union of tech workers with collective bargaining rights


- 1995: The Times Digital won a contract to become the nation’s first unionized newspaper website. Today, these staffers are now part of the Times Guild.

- 1980: Minority staff members of The Times Guild win a historic settlement for racial discrimination. The Times paid $680K, agreeing to move minorities into high-ranking management positions, provide journalism scholarships for minority students and give minority reporters opportunities to serve on choice news beats.

- 1978: Members of the Times Guild Women’s Caucus wins a landmark federal suit against The New York Times for sex discrimination. The Times agreed to place more women in all job levels and $350K to cover the costs of “delayed career advancement or denied opportunity.”

- 1965: The Times Guild successfully strikes to protect their pensions and management’s contributions to the pension fund. This fund has grown to $250M!


- 1942: The Times Guild expands to include maintenance & security officers. Our journalists work 24/7, 365 days a year. Journalism is an essential but dangerous profession. We recognize the invaluable role our frontline workers play in a free and independent press.


- 1941: The Times Guild won their first contract. This solidified a 40-hour workweek, pay for overtime, holiday, and severance, as well as maternity leave and other member benefits.


- 1940: The Times-Guild workers voted to unionize 418-198. This historic win happens despite aggressive union-busting tactics from NYT management who fired or demoted employees for union activities.
