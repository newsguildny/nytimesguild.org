Workers are qualified to determine their own working conditions. We know what policies we want and we know our worth. It’s not enough to rely on luck and our employers’ discretion to secure our quality of life. Only as an organized body with a collective voice can we have a fairer say in our jobs. I’m thrilled to join my coworkers in making The New York Times a better place to work.
