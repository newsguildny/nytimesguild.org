## For prospective Members

The Times Tech Guild includes everyone who helps to build the digital products and website at The New York Times. This includes ~700 individual contributors who are Engineers, Product Managers, Project Managers, Designers, and Data Analysts. If you’re applying to one of these roles, being a union member is a condition of your employment.

Before you’re hired, you already benefit from our guaranteed salary minimums. The Times can offer you more. We encourage you to negotiate and remind them our contract sets no maximum salary.

Once you’re hired, you’ll immediately be covered by our contract. This means a guaranteed minimum raise, on-call support training and pay, hybrid work schedule, and 6-month probationary period. We encourage you to talk to the hiring manager to negotiate a shorter probationary period in your offer letter.

As a member, you’ll be asked to pay union dues to help to keep our union strong. Your dues are divided across the year's paychecks and support essential contract enforcement needs like staff, legal fees, and training union representatives.

We encourage you to ask questions about working in a union during your interview!
