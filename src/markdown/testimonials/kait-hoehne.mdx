I love working at The Times and I love working in tech. I believe in our mission and in my team, but as a career changer and a woman in tech, I’m keenly aware that there are disparities that still pervade the industry. Your salary, your workload, and your career growth can be dictated by your background or just by sheer luck. We’re operating in an environment where the scales of power are out of balance, and we just have to hope for the best. Collective action will let us come together and take action - re-balance those scales. We can get to know each other better and support each other as a strong, collaborative community, regardless of where we are in the organization. We can advocate for the kind of workplace that will let us all thrive.
