I'm forever impressed by my coworkers, whose work I admire and whose curiosity and creativity make the tools and software we build together possible. Forming a union will allow us all to continue to do our best work here at The Times, by ensuring that we're paid fairly and treated equitably. We seek a voice in decisions about issues as specific as what our healthcare coverage is and how much it costs, and as broad as how we can create products and architectures that allow The Times to support its mission for another 170 years!
