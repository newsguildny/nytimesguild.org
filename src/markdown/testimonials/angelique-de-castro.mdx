The Times is the best company I’ve worked at, and it is all thanks to my incredible colleagues who make it so. Through a union, we can collectively advocate for working conditions we deserve by having a seat at the table to work with and hold our employer accountable to continuing to make this company worthy of its mission. Organizing with my peers has proven just how dedicated we are to having each other’s backs, and I could not be more proud to stand in solidarity with them.
