The WIRED Union is thrilled about the organizing that went into the Times Tech Guild and we are so excited to welcome you to the NewsGuild of New York. Tech workers and all who work for tech companies deserve fair, equitable, and decent working conditions. The Times Tech Guild is taking a stand at the intersection of media and tech,  both industries where the status quo for workers is, shall we say, ripe for disruption!
