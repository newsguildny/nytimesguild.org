I'm proud to be a Guild member because of the enormous, positive changes we've been able to affect at our workplace. I've worked at PCMag for 10 years, and in that time our concerns were rarely acted on and even basic improvements were out of reach. Forming our Union secured us fair pay, job security, and the protection to do our jobs. Our contract doesn't just protect us, it empowers us to do what we know is right. The Tech Guild has already had a long fight to get to this place, but it will be well worth it. Hang in there!
