I believe in democracy and transparency above all else, and I think that forming a tech union is the only way we’re going to be guaranteed those things. Forming a union allows us to negotiate for the issues that matter to all of us. The contract will ensure that we’re making and maintaining progress in these areas. With a union we can make decisions that are better for all of us, together.
