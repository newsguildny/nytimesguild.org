Before working here, I was given two answers over and over again when I asked why people loved working at The Times: the people and the journalism. After two years, I would give the same answer! I am motivated daily by working on products that make our journalism available to our readers and by a desire to see my colleagues be as successful as they can be. Having a union helps me do the latter in a tangible way. When we stand together, we have a say in the working conditions that make us successful. Through a contract, we can protect those conditions even as leadership inevitably changes. My talented, thoughtful, incredible colleagues deserve nothing less!
