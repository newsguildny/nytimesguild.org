I enjoy working at The New York Times. When I’m asked about what keeps me working here, I always say that it’s because of the excellent people who I work with, and the journalistic mission of the company. I’m excited and proud to join my awesome colleagues in forming a union, and I know that with our ability to collectively bargain, The New York Times will become an even better place to work.
