On March 3, 2022, [The New York Times Tech Guild won its certification vote](https://nytimesguild.org/tech-vote-count) with a whopping 80% of votes in favor. Throughout the day, over seven thousand people watched the vote count live on our website, which we had updated the week before to include a live-updating vote count page. Winning our certification by such a large margin was a huge victory, and so was the excitement we generated about our new unit!

## Why we built a live vote count page

A week or so before our certification vote, one of the members of our Organizing Committee, Vicki Crosson, had a brilliant idea: We should make it possible for everyone in our unit to see the vote count live. The actual act of counting the physical paper ballots took place in the New York City headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board, and only **\[not sure who?]** was allowed to be there in person. There was a live Zoom feed of the entire process that anyone in the unit could join, but since the vote count was occurring during the workday, very few people would actually be able to follow the video call in real time.
