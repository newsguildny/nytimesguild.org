## Our Plan

The existing unit’s Bargaining Committee and Contract Action Team have developed a platform of top-priority issues to address in negotiations through hundreds of 1-on-1 conversations with members and through a bargaining survey, which nearly 1,000 Guild members participated in. The BC and CAT have identified the most widely and deeply felt issues, for which the membership will fight to secure significant wins.

The Times is thriving because of our hard work. Now it is up to us to demand a new contract that reflects our values. You’ll hear more from CAT members throughout the campaign about ways you can take action to push Times management to agree to proposals on our platform and beyond. The more members who participate, the more leverage the Bargaining Committee has to demand better.

Members are united and ready to win a contract that lifts industry standards and rewards the people who have made The Times so successful. We also stand by The Times' tech workers, who have unionized and will be negotiating a separate contact.

The existing union is determined to win big on the following issues:

## Pay

**Members Say:** We need women and people of color to have pay parity with white men. Our pay study showed us that the typical woman on staff earns approximately 6 percent (about $7,000 annually) less than the typical man. Median pay for people of color was about $10,000 less than for white employees.

**Let’s Fight For:** Let’s correct these disparities through higher pay minimums that close the gap and a commitment to ending pay inequities—now.

**Members Say:** Women and people of color are significantly underrepresented in the most highly compensated reporting and editing roles in the newsroom.

**Let’s Fight For:** Promotions for women of color to leadership roles, including a recommendation that the company interview a specific number of candidates from underrepresented groups for every non-entry-level job. 

**Members Say:** There is a “loyalty penalty” for employees who were hired during a downturn.

**Let’s Fight For:** A raise for long-term employees whose salaries are lower than average, with a guaranteed annual review of salary parity. 

**Members Say:** The Times is thriving financially because of our hard work. The Times’ executives, cash position and shareholders are all seeing the rewards of that success. It’s time we do too.

**Let’s Fight For:** Meaningful raises on our base pay that reward our contributions.

## Healthcare

**Members Say:** Out-of-pocket costs are simply too high. The company should do more to subsidize health care, particularly to improve mental health and fertility coverage. 

**Let’s Fight For:** Larger company contributions to our health-care plan, so we can provide our members with affordable care for their medical needs at rates comparable to those at our peer companies; expanded fertility benefits to support our members in their family planning; and equitable treatment for temporary and casual workers employed by the company on a regular basis.

## Career Development

**Members Say:** We want a workplace that doesn’t require a tap on the shoulder to get ahead. Career growth at The New York Times shouldn’t depend on who you know and how well you are liked by your managers. 

**Let’s Fight For:** Open positions where the qualifications are transparent and equal treatment is guaranteed.

**Members Say:** Dead-end jobs and a lack of mobility at The Times push good people out the door.

**Let’s Fight For:** Policies that encourage people to stay at The Times, like sabbaticals, preservation of intellectual property rights, more accommodating book leaves and a reclassification of those jobs that have no obvious path to move up.

## Remote Work

**Members Say:** We’ve covered the biggest news year of a century completely remotely. There’s no reason we can’t continue this success.

**Let’s Fight For:** Empowering employees to decide where they feel safest and most productive working without imposing unnecessary limitations.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

**Members Say:** We need the company to set clear cut goals that can be both quantified and felt. 

**Let’s Fight For:** A culture and practices that encourage internal hires to advance at the company.

**Members Say:** Retention is the biggest issue I see with my BIPOC colleagues. So much great talent has left. 

**Let’s Fight For:** An annual accounting of the company’s diversity statistics — including hiring, promotion and retention data by department and title — to be published publicly on The Times Company website.

**Members Say:** Career development for people of color should include a path toward regular consideration for promotions or changes in duties that reflect the employee’s interests and expertise.

**Let’s Fight For:** A commitment from the company to seek out underrepresented applicants for senior editorial decision-making positions.

**Members Say:** We should have outreach on fellowships and early career opportunities at HBCUs and community colleges.

**Let’s Fight For:** A contractual commitment from the company that recruitment efforts will be aimed at increasing employment of underrepresented groups, as well as increasing their opportunities for promotion and advancement within the company.

## Bargaining Committee

The Bargaining Committee is the group of member leaders who will negotiate with representatives of Times management for a new contract. The unit polled the members to find out their top priorities for the new contract in a rapidly changing workplace and drafted a platform of contract proposals addressing those issues. This month the committee began presenting its requests to management in negotiations for a new contract, with the goal of arriving swiftly at a muscular agreement that reflects our dedication, our hard work and our multiple talents.

New York Times Guild 2021 Bargaining Committee is made up of the following members:

* Davey Alba (Business)
* Bill Baker (Tech)
* Adriana Balsamo (News Design)
* Ken Belson (Sports)
* Stacey Cowley (Business)
* Daniel Lenos (Advertising)
* Caitlin Lovinger (Digital Transition)
* Jim Luttrell (Print Hub)
* Kathleen Massara (Culture)
* Shane O'Neill (Video)
* Frances "Frenchie" Robles (National/Foreign)
* Bedel Saget (Graphics)
* Helen Verongos (Culture)
* Erin Wright (Community)

## Contract Action Team

The Contract Action Team is a group of member leaders responsible for ensuring the entire membership is engaged in the contract campaign. CAT reps check in with members in their department to keep them updated on the process, solicit feedback and input on bargaining demands, and engage them in collective actions to support the bargaining team.
