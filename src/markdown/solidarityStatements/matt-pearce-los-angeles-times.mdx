I’m a reporter at the Los Angeles Times and helped unionize our newsroom in 2018. Management then said a union would only divide us; instead, it taught me and my coworkers how to have each others’ backs. Management then said all our pay and benefits would be up for negotiation, and there was no guarantee we’d end up with a better deal; I joined our bargaining committee, and we won life-changing compensation increases. Management then said a union would make us less flexible; as president of our union, I now spend time every week helping fix everyday problems management doesn’t know how to fix so that our newsroom stays steady and strong. In the end, a union isn’t something you just vote for. It’s something you do. Vote yes, and do what it takes to make your union a great one.
