    <p>Ballot counting will take place on Thursday, March 3rd.</p>
    <p>
      This vote determines whether or not our union is certified, and is decided by a simple
      majority (50% +1 vote) of total ballots. The vertical line in the center of the bar graph
      indicates the number of votes needed to decide the outcome.

    <p>
      Before each ballot is counted, either party can challenge a ballot. If management has reason
      to doubt a voter&rsquo;s current employment status, signature, or eligibility, for example,
      they can challenge the ballot. The NLRB officer can accept or dismiss the challenge. If the
      challenge is accepted, the ballot is set aside and will only be counted if all challenged
      ballots are determinative for the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NLRB will first count unchallenged ballots. If a simple majority of total ballots is
      reached in the initial count, our union will be officially certified. Otherwise, challenged
      ballots will be reviewed for eligibility and counted.
    </p>

    Times management has chosen to challenge {contested} ballot{contested !== 1 ? 's' : ''}. Because
    the initial count did not show a simple majority, the NLRB will resolve the eligibility disputes
    of challenged votes and count them.

      The NLRB has counted a majority of votes in the Times Tech Guild&rsquo;s favor! The

    The NLRB ballot count has concluded, and unfortunately the Times Tech Guild did not gain a
