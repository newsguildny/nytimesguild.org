There was a big push to improve DEI at a company I used to work for. The company hired an advocate and gave her the funding and authority to analyze the situation. There were surveys and interviews and a consulting firm involved. It took months for the report to come out but the results weren't a surprise to anyone. Things were bad, especially in engineering. The DEI advocate created a task force and invited people to join. I got involved and spent weeks putting together a proposal to expand new graduate recruiting to diverse areas and universities. I made phone calls, looked through public records, made maps and broke down statistics. The DEI advocate loved my idea and said she'd be happy to sponsor it.

She left the company shortly after and my idea never came to fruition. She was never replaced and the company's interest in DEI just faded away. I was crushed for two reasons:

1. All my hard work was for nothing. No one else at the company ever even saw my proposal.
2. This showed me the advocate had lost hope in the company. If she was hired solely to care about this and she gave up, why should I keep taking on all of this outside of my day-to-day work?

I began to see things differently after that. It struck me that as long as companies focus solely on growth and profit they will have no incentive to address internal problems. Even if they are aware of a problem. Even if they have the means to solve the problem. Even if individuals at the company want to solve the problem.

This is why I believe workers need to have a seat at the table. The individuals that make up a company should have a voice and an opportunity to improve conditions for themselves and their fellow workers. It is the only way to ensure a fair and transparent process that everyone can participate in.I look forward to seeing underrepresented groups have a voice and a path forward protected by a union contract.
