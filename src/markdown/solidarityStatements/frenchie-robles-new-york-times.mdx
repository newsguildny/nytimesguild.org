When I think of various benefits that we reporters have at the Times, like getting paid out for accumulated comp days or being paid for an hour's work on weekends, I'm very clear that those kinds of rights didn't come out of thin air. They came because union members got together and fought for them. I've gotten more active in the past year, serving on the unit council and the bargaining committee, and it's been really exciting to be able to serve as a front line on behalf of our members. I'm the kind of person who speaks her mind and calls out injustice. It's pretty cool to know that, because Iâ€™m in the Guild, I can do that at work, too.
