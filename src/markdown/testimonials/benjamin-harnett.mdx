I have worked at The Times for almost a decade, and I look forward to working here for another ten years. I have been extraordinarily lucky in my working conditions, but I know the same isn’t true for all my colleagues, and that there’s no guarantee my luck will hold. I think it’s important that The Times is a place people want to make their home, and it’s absolutely crucial for us, the workers, to have not only a say, but the power to make sure this is true. Everyone’s incentives should be aligned toward one thing: the long term health of the enterprise and its workers, the people who make it all happen. I look forward to working together to build the future with all of you.
