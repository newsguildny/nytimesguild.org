The Times Tech Guild includes everyone who helps to build the digital products and website at The New York Times. This includes ~700 individual contributors who are Engineers, Product Managers, Project Managers, Designers, and Data Analysts. **Being a union member is a condition of employment for these roles.**

## For new members
Welcome to the union! We’re so glad to have you in our community! Signing a membership card is the first and most important thing you can do: it authorizes dues and allows you to vote in elections, ratify contracts, authorize strikes and more.

**Each quarter we host a new member onboarding to the union.** This helps you learn more about how to get involved and learn your rights in the workplace. Our union slack offers info on onboarding sessions in #q-and-a. Explore our other channels as well! #general and #chat are always full of great conversation and updates.

**Every member has the right to union representation with management in disciplinary meetings.** Union stewards are fellow teammates who are your main contacts for union updates. Most people meet at least 1x a month with their steward. We have nearly 100 stewards in our union who can be your representative. It’s also a great way to get involved if you’d like to volunteer your time.

**Every member must remain active to create a fair and equitable workplace.** Join a working group or member caucus to help out. Many tasks can be done async, during the workday, or as a single task. Learn more about where you can get involved.

**A strong contract only happens when all of us act together to improve our workplace experiences.** The Contract Action Team, or CAT, is a group of rank and file members who help organize our union to take and enforce our contract. The CAT includes: stewards, contract committee members who meet with management, internal working groups, and elected unit officers and council members.

**Stay informed by reading The Week in your personal email or on Union Slack.** This member run digest keeps members informed on what's happening including upcoming events, collective actions, and more. [Read the latest in our unit library](https://nytimesguild.org/tech/library).
