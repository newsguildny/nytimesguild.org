## Our Approach to DEI

The existing Times Guild of New York and the newly-formed Times Tech Guild have many shared concerns, but one of the most crucial is a clear and sustained commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

A workplace characterized by integrity and respect and enriched by a plurality of voices is essential to our mission. To truly uphold the ideals The Times espouses, to make “society stronger and more just,” we must champion them with the same tenacity and dedication in practice as we do on the page.

The Times must become more diverse. This is not lip service, corporate good citizenship or a favor from management to our BIPOC colleagues. It is core to what The Times must do to broaden its audience and improve how it covers the world. Diversity is how our coverage becomes more comprehensive, more nuanced, more variegated, more vibrant. The leadership of the New York Times has said this, and we agree. 

But this transformation requires a sustained commitment from the publisher on down. 

It also requires more than listening. For these changes to take hold and be effective, they must come from collaboration across all people at the New York Times, not the pronouncements of consultants and management committees.

Below, you’ll find our open exploration of these profoundly important issues, as well as our recommendations on how we can improve diversity and inclusion at The Times in a meaningful way.
