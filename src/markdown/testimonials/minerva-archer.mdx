I love working at The New York Times because my coworkers care deeply about our journalistic mission and about each other. By working closely together across disciplines and missions, tech workers at The New York Times deliver best-in-class products that support critical business and journalistic work. I'm excited for us to use those same collaborative skills to help the company meet its goal of building a more fair and equitable workplace.
