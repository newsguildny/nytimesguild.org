I'm proud to be part of raising the bar for our industry. When people have better working conditions, not only do they have better lives, but the work they create together prospers even more. I'm proud we fight for getting rid of NDAs in terms of harassment, so the workplace can be safer. I'm proud that we have the right to hold workplaces accountable for DEI, making actions match words and promises. I'm proud that we know that when we stand up together, we can create change.
