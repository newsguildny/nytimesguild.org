I’ve learned so much about the true meaning of solidarity in forming this union with my colleagues—the relationships we’ve built and the compassion we have for each other have made the experience of working at The Times that much better. Forming a union is the best opportunity we have to get a say in how we work, to make sure we're all treated fairly while at work, and to join management at the highest levels in making sure The Times stays a great place to work.
