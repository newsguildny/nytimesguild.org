## Our Plan

The Bargaining Committee and Contract Action Team developed a platform of top priority issues to address in negotiations through hundreds of 1 on 1 conversations with members and a bargaining survey, which nearly 1,000 members participated in. The BC and CAT identified the most widely felt, deeply felt issues that the membership will fight to secure significant wins on. 

We have the power to win all of this, and more. The Times is thriving because of our hard work. Now it is up to us to demand an even stronger contract. You’ll hear more from CAT members throughout the campaign about ways you can take action to push Times management to agree to proposals on our platform and beyond. The more members who participate, the more leverage the Bargaining Committee has to demand better. Join us. It’s time to win an incredible contract.

Members are united and ready to win a contract that lifts industry standards and rewards the people who have made the Times so successful. We are determined to win big on the following issues:

## Pay

**Our Members Say:** We need women and people of color to have pay parity with white men. The Guild’s pay study showed us that the typical woman on staff earns approximately 6 percent (about $7,000 annually) less than the typical man. Median pay for people of color was about $10,000 less than for white employees.

**Let’s Fight For:** Let’s correct these disparities through higher pay minimums that close the gap and a commitment to ending pay inequities—now.

**Our Members Say:** Women and people of color are significantly underrepresented in the most highly compensated reporting and editing roles in the newsroom.

**Let’s Fight For:** Support promotions for women of color in leadership, including a recommendation to interview a minimum number of underrepresented candidates for every non-entry-level job. 

**Our Members Say:** There is a “loyalty penalty” for employees who were hired during a downturn.

**Let’s Fight For:** A raise for long-term employees whose salaries are lower than average, with a guaranteed annual review of salary parity.

**Our Members Say:** The Times is thriving financially because of our hard work. The Times’ executives, cash position, and shareholders are all seeing the rewards of that success. It’s time we do too.

**Let’s Fight For:** Meaningful raises on our base pay that reward our contribution.

## Healthcare

**Our Members Say:** Out of pocket costs are simply too high. The company should do more to subsidize health care, particularly to improve mental health and fertility coverage. 

**Let’s Fight For:** Larger company contributions to our health care plan, so we can provide our members with affordable care for their medical needs at rates comparable to those at our peer companies. Expanded fertility benefits to support our members in their family planning. Equitable treatment for temporary and casual workers employed by the company on a regular basis.

## Career Development

**Our Members Say:** We want a workplace that doesn’t require a tap on the shoulder to get ahead. Career growth at The New York Times shouldn’t depend on who you know and how well you are liked by your managers. 

**Let’s Fight For:** Open positions where the qualifications are transparent and equal treatment is guaranteed.

**Our Members Say:** Dead end jobs and a lack of mobility at The Times push good people out the door.

**Let’s Fight For:** Policies that encourage people to stay at The Times, like sabbaticals, preservation of intellectual property rights, more accommodating book leaves and a reclassification of jobs with no obvious path to move up.

## Remote Work

**Our Members Say:** We’ve covered the biggest news year of a century completely remote. There’s no reason we can’t continue this success.

**Let’s Fight For:**  Empowering employees to decide where they feel safest and most productive to work without imposing unnecessary limitations.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

**Our Members Say:** We need the company to set clear cut goals that can be not only quantified, but also felt. 

**Let’s Fight For:** A culture and practices that encourage internal hires to advance at the company.

**Our Members Say:** Retention is the biggest issue I see with my BIPOC colleagues. So much great talent has left. 

**Let’s Fight For:** An annual accounting of the company’s diversity statistics — including hiring, promotion and retention data by department and title — to be published publicly on the Times Company website.

**Our Members Say:** Career development for people of color should include a path toward being regularly considered for promotions or changes in duties.

**Let’s Fight For:** A commitment from the company that they seek out underrepresented applicants for senior editorial decision-making positions.

**Our Members Say:** We should have outreach on fellowships and early career opportunities at HBCUs and community colleges.

**Let’s Fight For:** A contractual commitment from the company that recruitment efforts will be aimed at increasing employment of underrepresented groups, as well as increasing their opportunities for promotion and advancement within the company.
