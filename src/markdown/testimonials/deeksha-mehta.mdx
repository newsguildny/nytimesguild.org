I love working at The Times, not just because I care deeply about our journalistic mission but also because I get to work with incredibly talented and thoughtful individuals to help build and support our product. Iâ€™m proud to form a union with my colleagues because I believe having a more democratic workplace, where our collective voice and unique perspectives are heard, can only make The Times even better.
