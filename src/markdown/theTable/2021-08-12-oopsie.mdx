### OOPSIE! A SNEAK PEEK AT UNION BUSTING tactics

This week, we shared what we might call an “oopsie” from management. A lawyer from  Proskauer Rose, the union-busting firm they employ, accidentally emailed a Guild staff member a slide deck with their entire legal strategy for handling our union.

We’ve added annotations (on the right side of the slides) for both context and myth busting, but the big takeaway is that, out of three different strategies to settle on a unit definition, management deliberately chose the most aggressive one, excluding as many employees as possible.

It’s easy to be disheartened by the way this deck describes us, but it reinforces how essential it is to stand together. Our union is built on hope for a better workplace — one that reflects our values. With that as our north star, we can’t lose.

### LESS UNION BUSTING, MORE VOTING!

On Wednesday, August 11, the members of the Times Tech Guild staged a walkout starting at 12 p.m. ET. This was prompted by a pattern of unfair labor practices (ULPs) that we have seen from the company.

Management has polled union support, prevented our coworkers from showing their support, and spread misinformation about who is eligible to participate. Additionally, they communicated that their proposed unit (and the NLRB vote) would exclude everyone but engineers. Through our walkout, we’re calling on management to stop using delaying tactics and ULPs. We’re also standing in solidarity to show that they cannot divide us.

With limited time until the company’s deadline for responding to our NLRB proposal, we were not initially planning for a unit-wide action. We were prepared for a walkout with a smaller group, something that we could quickly organize. As we notified the rest of the unit, we were thrilled at how rapidly and steadily the number of pledges began to grow. Beyond a symbolic gesture, the action showed the strength of our commitment, and our willingness to all stand up for each other.

### TODO ??

On Monday, August 9th, Wirecutter Union members walked out on our lunch break to demand fair wages and tell management that **we know what we’re worth**. We had a wonderful turnout—some members even dropped in from vacation to voice their support—and it was a huge success. We win by showing our collective strength (like how we fought for and won Just Cause last year!) and we plan to keep up this momentum to win fair wages and wrap up our contract.

But in the following bargaining session, management presented yet another insulting counter on wages. The company’s latest proposal moves the floor for band 1 employees to $55,000, and doesn’t budge a cent from their previous proposal on the other tiers, staying at $62,000 and $70,000. Under this proposal, just 14 members would receive raises—eleven in band 1, three in band 2, and none in band 3—averaging just $1,962 each, for a grand total of $27,464 added to payroll. The bargaining committee pushed back strongly on management’s inadequate proposal and lack of movement that would provide meaningful improvements aimed at **closing the massive wage gap** between our members and our colleagues across the company.

Management’s counter also continues to refuse our proposals for guaranteed yearly raises and a more equitable bonus plan, despite admitting that it wouldn’t be “overly burdensome” to implement. They stated they’re simply “not interested in keeping track of” another plan.

Clearly, wrapping up this contract and winning fair wages, guaranteed yearly increases, and a more equitable bonus structure is **going to be a fight**. Our lunch walkout was a powerful step! We’re prepared to take further actions to keep the pressure on management and to make it clear that we know what we’re worth and we won’t settle for less. We’d appreciate as much cross-shop solidarity on these future actions as we can get!
