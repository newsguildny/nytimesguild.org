I’m proud to be a Guild member because I know when we fight, we win — just like we’ve won just cause protections, a ban on NDAs in cases of harassment or discrimination, protections against using traffic for discipline, and strong health and safety and remote work rights. And we’re not even done with our first contract yet! I know your union will win all of these incredible workplace protections and more. Stay strong, and vote yes!!
