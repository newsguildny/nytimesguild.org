I have been at The New York Times long enough to have seen it grow through a number of changes. The Times is a great company with an ever-important mission. I have seen the strength in our technologists over the years. I have also seen the struggles of many of my peers that are not being addressed transparently or effectively. Many of these struggles fall into the hands of management. For too long we've relied on the fact that The New York Times is a good place to work and not the best place to work. I believe that leadership comes from all and that with the proper voice, we can address our problems better than we can in our current situation. I believe that a strong union will not only empower all of our brothers and sisters in and around the technology space, but it will help strengthen The Times as a powerhouse in the industry. Unity brings strength.
