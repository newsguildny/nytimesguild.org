It’s been a joy and honor to work for The Times. Being here, even remotely, has been fulfilling in a way that I don’t think a lot of jobs can be, and it’s been amazing to feel that our work impacts the world for the better. I am so inspired by the people I work with and proud to organize with them, and I believe we can collectively help make the workplace better, too. As a union, we can strengthen The Times as a whole for all of us, and I am excited for what we will accomplish together.
