Being a Guild member provides me with more opportunities to make The New York Times a better place, not only for our employees but also for our readers. As a journalist who has covered major companies for years, I know that most businesses are loath to provide employees with information on hiring and retention practices, particularly ones that might demonstrate evidence of bias. But through the Guild, we have the right to access such data and use it to hold the company accountable. For example, Guild employees were able to obtain details of performance review results and use them to show that there was a statistically significant bias by race. I have worked at non-union shops and can tell you that, without our right to such data through our union, it would be practically impossible to have done this.
