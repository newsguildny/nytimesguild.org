Since the companies we work for are organized by definition, the only way to have a cohesive voice as workers is with organization of our own. There is an explicit power imbalance between workers and their employers, and, systemically, workers need a way to have our voices heard autonomously, independently, and cohesively. An independent newspaper like the New York Times is an obvious place for organizing in the early stages of a new national labor movement.
