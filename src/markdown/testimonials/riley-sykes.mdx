I am constantly impressed by the thoughtfulness and dedication that my colleagues bring to their work every day. The New York Times does the essential job of seeking the truth and helping people understand the world. We would not be able to achieve such goals without our incredible workforce. By organizing together we will be able to create a democratic, supportive, and inclusive environment in service of those who have made The Times everything it is today. I canâ€™t wait to see what we will be able to accomplish when every voice is truly heard.
