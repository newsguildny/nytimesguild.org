I support the NYT tech workersâ€™ right to unionize and to bargain for a fair contract. Unions are one of the best tools for workers to have a real say in their workplace through a democratic process. As a union, workers can hold companies accountable when they see discrimination, questionable disciplinary actions, or unsafe working conditions in ways that would not be possible as an individual employee.
