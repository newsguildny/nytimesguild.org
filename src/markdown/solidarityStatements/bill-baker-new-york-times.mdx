I have spent most of my career being part of a union. I can say that the few years that I was not were the most troubling. Being in a union has given me a sense of authority over my working conditions. It has allowed me to be vocal about issues at work without fear of reprisal. It's comforting to know that my colleagues and I have common interests that bond us together to make our workplace better for everyone. When NYT had no interest in analyzing salaries for pay disparities, our union used the language in our contract to gather the information needed to do our own study. This resulted in pay increases for many and a new corporate compensation committee with pay studies done more frequently. The Guild's ability to speak collectively on issues pertaining to DEI over the years has 'inspired' management to create some of the policies that are now in place. When management cut pensions for excluded employees we were able to keep ours because of our union. Each time there is an attempt to erode or violate our contract, either by creating a multi-tiered salary structure for reporters or an attempt to layoff hundreds of copy editors, I am reminded that if it were not for Guild members who spoke up and walked out, the Times would impose their will without resistance. For these reasons and more, I am a proud Guild member and am looking forward to the day that your vote will give us even more voice in our workplace together!
