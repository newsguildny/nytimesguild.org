With a union we have a path to redress the exploitation we're subject to as unprotected workers. A union gives us a way to participate directly in the decisions that impact our lives, and the security to stand up for ourselves and for each other in ways that would not have been possible. I’m honored to do this work at The Times — which, through our collective labor, works day in and day out to hold power accountable.
