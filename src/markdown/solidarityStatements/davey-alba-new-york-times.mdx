I'm proud to be part of a community where the driving ethos is that YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE YOUR BACK and want better benefits for all. It's an incredibly powerful way to push back against inequities in the system, and make the workplace — where we spend most of our waking hours — a fairer, more welcoming, more inclusive place for individuals, no matter where you come from or what views you hold. Solidarity forever with my tech union colleagues. ✊
