Throughout my years at Wirecutter, and especially during the pandemic (and Wirecutter's correlated growth), it's been made painfully obvious to me that the Times cares more about profits than people. Being part of our union has allowed me to fight against the negativity from the top. Of course there's the success in terms of the contract, which raised our minimum salaries significantly, set guaranteed annual increases, eliminated the use of NDAs, enacted just cause protections, and so much more, but just as importantly, there's the camaraderie that comes with it all. We are the only ones who are looking out for one another. We know the struggles we face, and the solutions to those problems. If we don't come together to advocate for better, no one is going to grant it. I wholly support the Tech Guild in your fight, and can't wait to welcome you as members of the Guild!
