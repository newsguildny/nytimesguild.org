Having experienced the tangible benefits of a union before, I was ecstatic to join this organizing effort. Together, we can work toward pay equity, reducing the impact of racism and sexism in our workplace, vacation days that don't expire at the end of a year, career development, and so much more. With a union, the Times will only become a better place to work.
