When I first joined The New York Times three years ago, I was so excited to work for a company whose mission is one I deeply care about. What I’ve learned over my time here is that, as amazing as the mission is, the people working towards it are better. I’m constantly inspired by how passionate, knowledgeable and empathetic my coworkers are. I feel so lucky to get to work beside and learn from them every day. With this union, I'm excited for us all to have a voice in our workplace and to get to work collectively on improving our environment.
