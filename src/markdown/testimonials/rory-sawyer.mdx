I'm honored to work alongside so many brilliant individuals at The New York Times. However, like our efforts to support the mission of The New York Times, we can move beyond individualism and support each other by improving the consistency of our working conditions, protecting the resources we have today, and having a say in how we help our readers experience and understand the world we live in.
