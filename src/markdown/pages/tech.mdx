## Our Mission

We choose to work at The New York Times because we care deeply about our mission. The same values that brought us here — integrity, respect and collaboration — compel us to organize.

We believe that a vibrant and healthy workplace is not only compatible with our mission, it is essential to it. To truly uphold the ideals The Times espouses, to make “society stronger and more just,” we must champion them with the same tenacity and dedication in practice as we do on the page. By forming a union, we can address some of our most pressing issues:

**We strive for excellence**, but recognize that it is predicated on fairness and transparency around compensation. Excellence also comes over time: it is built through clear, equitable promotion processes.

**We strive for a curious and collaborative work environment**, but understand that can only be achieved through independence, as well as clear roles and responsibilities.

**We strive for a workplace characterized by integrity and respect**, one that is diverse, representative, and equitable. One enriched by a plurality of voices.

Solidarity in our upcoming contract campaign empowers us to pursue these goals, and allows us to stand with our peers where they have previously stood alone.
