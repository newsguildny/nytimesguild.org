    <p>Ballot counting will take place on Thursday, March 3rd.</p>
    <p>
      This vote determines whether or not our union is certified, and is decided by a simple
      majority (50% +1 vote) of total ballots. The vertical line in the center of the bar graph
      indicates the number of votes needed to decide the outcome.

    <p>
      Before each ballot is counted, management can challenge. If they have reason to doubt a
      voter&rsquo;s current employment status or unit eligibility, for example, they can request
      that the voter&rsquo;s ballot be set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NLRB will first count unchallenged ballots. If a simple majority is reached in the initial
      count or the number of challenged ballots cannot sway the outcome of the vote, our union will
      be officially certified. Otherwise, challenged ballots will be reviewed for eligibility and
      counted.
