## Let’s build the future of journalism together

We are the Analysts, Designers, Engineers, Product Managers, and Program Managers who build the New York Times websites and mobile applications, and we're joining our coworkers in an effort to build wall-to-wall solidarity at The New York Times.

In December, 2024, after three years of fighting NYT management's strategy to delay, divide, and distract us, we successfully ratified our first contract.

It took a lot of creative organizing to accomplish our goals, but we were undeterred. Thanks to dozens of collective actions and the largest tech workers strike in American history, we won:

- Just Cause
- Guaranteed salary minimums and annual raises
- On-call pay
- Remote work protections and return-to-office schedules
- Protections for gender identity
- Improved immigration and visa support
- Layoff protections
- Conference budgets
- Defined grievance and arbitration procedures
- Member-led committees
- Generative AI protections

## The Stewards' Pledge

Our union is over 700 members strong. We want to support the New York Times to fulfill its journalistic mission by creating an inclusive environment in which workers  have the opportunity to do their best work. We believe that is done by sharing experiences, building worker power, and enforcing our contract rights.To do this, we have nearly 100 members pledged as member stewards.
