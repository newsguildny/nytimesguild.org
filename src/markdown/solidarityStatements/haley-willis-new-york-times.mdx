I am incredibly proud to be active in a Guild that has continually been at the forefront of fighting for the issues most important to me: diversity, equitable compensation, affordable healthcare. I have personally directly benefited from organizing with my colleagues using our Guild contract, winning raises for myself and several other colleagues who were wrongly classified and unfairly compensated. I admire the passion with which the Times Tech Guild has continued to push forward in the face of the company's union-busting tactics. With the election approaching, I only encourage you all to continue doing so. Being on the other side, I can't emphasize enough the community and safety that comes with having a union â€” it's that strength that has allowed us to be so vocal about how we can make this a better workplace, and that's been invaluable.
