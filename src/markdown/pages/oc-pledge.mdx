## Our Pledge

We are forming a union because we care about The New York Times and want to make it the best company it can be. To do this, we pledge to stand in solidarity as an organizing committee.

Technology is an integral part of The New York Times. Over the last decade, it has grown to be the second largest branch of the company, right after the Newsroom. Consequently, we as Technology workers are in a position to leverage our collective power and build a foundation to enact change and institute protections for workers for decades to come.

We are already united as coworkers committed to the stewardship of this important institution. We are already
motivated by mutual respect and the recognition of our colleagues’ humanity, regardless of their eligibility in ourbargaining unit. We are focusing this commitment and motivation into organizing a union in order to create an environment where our values are at the forefront of our work. Our priorities come from grassroots conversations with unit members, and will evolve over time, but they include efforts to improve equity, career advancement, and health care benefits across our unit. It is only through a union that we can hold the company accountable to meet these goals.

Shifting existing power structures to give workers a democratic say in our working conditions is a big change! There will be difficult and uncertain times ahead of us, but the only way forward is together.

We as Organizing Committee members commit to standing with every member of the unit throughout this
process. We commit to treating each other with kindness and respect and to giving each other (and ourselves) grace when this work is hard to manage. We commit to taking concrete action if any unit member were to face retaliation for supporting the union, including job actions, filing charges with the National Labor Relations Board, and organizing public campaigns of support. Together, united, we have the power to make The New York Times the best it can be.

In solidarity,

**The Organizing Committee**
