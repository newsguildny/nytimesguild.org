I’ve been at The Times for more than a decade now. It’s been a great pleasure and a tremendous honor to serve the mission of the company and be counted among all the amazing people that work here. I would very much like those notions to be common, defining features of the employment experience at The Times. The surest way to make that a reality is for the workers here to be empowered self-advocates, speaking with a shared voice. I also strongly believe that the formation of a union is not only *compatible* with the long-term interests of the company, it is *an essential prerequisite* for the institution’s ability to successfully anticipate and adapt to the frequent, dramatic shifts in the technological, cultural, and journalistic landscapes which we are tasked to straddle. To me, this endeavor is not an *alteration of* or *confrontation with* the culture or core principles of The Times; it is merely a belated extension of that culture and of those principles into the realm of an already-extended workforce.
