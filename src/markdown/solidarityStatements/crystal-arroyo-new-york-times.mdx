Being a part of the union has given me a feeling of kinship with my fellow coworkers. We have performed actions together, such as the walkout in 2017, that allowed me to feel empowered while also knowing that I was protected from retaliation. Being a Guild member has also meant there were set wages for the jobs I’ve occupied, guaranteed bonuses and wage increases. This is not something I’ve ever had in any other job. I feel all employees should be guaranteed these things and support the Tech Guild in your fight to be recognized.
