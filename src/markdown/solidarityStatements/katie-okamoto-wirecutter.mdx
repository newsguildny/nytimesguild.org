I'm so incredibly proud to be part of the Guild. It's made me really understand the importance of community and solidarity in this industry. As a former freelancer, I didn't fully realize how daunted, stressed, and alone I felt until I joined my union and experienced a 180. We won major, tangible improvements with our first contract, and it was because of my union and the awe-inspiring support from Guild members across other shops. We achieve and will achieve so much more together.
