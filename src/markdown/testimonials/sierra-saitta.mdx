Iâ€™m excited to join my colleagues in forming a union because I know that we can make our company into a place where everyone has an equal opportunity to grow and thrive. By using our power collectively, we can protect what we love about our workplace, demand changes to the things we want to see amended, and establish a constructive relationship between employees and leadership.
