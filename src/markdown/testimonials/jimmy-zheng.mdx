I believe in both diversity and fairness. Although I love working for The New York Times for its diversity and inclusion, there is still room for the company to improve, especially for expatriates.

Given that the relationship between The Times and the employee is not quite balanced, our voice may not be read loud and clear, and there are limited ways for us to unite. I'm so happy to see a union is being formed, and I look forward to making The Times a better workplace.
