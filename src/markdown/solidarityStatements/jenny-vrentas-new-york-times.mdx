Never forget the power of collective action: Together, you really can change your workplace and your industry. I experienced this firsthand as the unit chair of the Sports Illustrated Union, where we earned a contract that creates a more equitable pay structure with a $64,000 salary floor, protects the integrity of our work and greatly improves the company's diversity, equity and inclusion standards. I'm proud to work now for another Guild shop with a strong contract, where the workers have a say in how things are run, and eagerly await the Times Tech Guild officially having the same.
