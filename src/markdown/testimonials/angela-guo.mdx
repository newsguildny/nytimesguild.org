I love working at The Times. I’m proud to work here and care deeply about my colleagues. The conversations I’ve had with people across the company during organizing have solidified my belief that we all have so much in common, and that we can come together to make this a better, more equitable place for everyone. All workers deserve a voice in writing their working conditions! We got each other's backs.
