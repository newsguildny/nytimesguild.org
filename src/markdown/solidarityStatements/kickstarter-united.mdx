For decades, tech workers at The New York Times have labored alongside the unionized Times writers and creators supported by the Guild. It's time for every worker at this cultural institution to have a seat at the table.

This is a unique moment in the tech worker movement. The depth of solidarity and determination of the organizers at The Times is a testament to the organizing of countless workers in every industry who have tirelessly demonstrated the strength of collective action.

Tech workers at The Times are part of a rich narrative that's just beginning to unfold: the narrative of worker power in tech. I have every confidence that they will give us a good story.
