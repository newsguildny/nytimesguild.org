I love working at The New York Times, and Iâ€™m excited to form this union with my colleagues! We all care so much about our journalistic mission and work very hard to deliver the news to our readers. Tech workers getting a seat at the table and adding our voice to decision-making around our products and policies will only make our work and our organization stronger!
