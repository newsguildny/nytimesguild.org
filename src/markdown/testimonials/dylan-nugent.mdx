I believe that the future of work in tech—and beyond—will require us to band together, stick up for one another, and create systems of collective support. A union is the strongest way for us as workers to shape and grow the place we work. I'm thrilled to be lending my voice to this effort and standing up with all of my colleagues. I couldn't be more proud that we're leading the way for unionization in tech at The Times, and hope that we can build frameworks for diversity, pay equity and transparency, sane working conditions, and so much more that will resonate throughout the industry as a whole.
