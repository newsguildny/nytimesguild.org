Helping to build this tech union with my colleagues has been one of the most inspiring things I have ever been a part of. As a Pacific Islander and a woman, I have never felt more job security as I have when listening to my colleagues validate the importance of transparency, equality, and democracy in the workplace. Unions are so important for those of us who have normally felt completely underrepresented. Collective power ensures that the issues that affect us disproportionately are heard, and that we get a place in the room when trying to solve them.

Solidarity forever, baby!!
