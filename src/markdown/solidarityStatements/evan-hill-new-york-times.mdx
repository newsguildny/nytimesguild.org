Before I joined the Times in 2019, I simply didn't know how powerful it would feel to be a union member: the sense of solidarity, the knowledge that you have hundreds of people at your back and a contract to protect you. Where once I might've felt precarious in any given job, I now feel secure. It's like a super power.
