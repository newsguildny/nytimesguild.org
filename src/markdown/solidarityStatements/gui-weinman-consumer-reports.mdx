Bargaining for your job. What a concept! But it's true, for a business to stay in business it needs to earn more revenue than the cost of what it sells. This is where bargaining happens. I've been working since I was a teenager, and my employer has always earned more money than they've paid me. It's just the way things work. I work at a not for profit 501c3 company called Consumer Reports. One would think that revenue would come back to employees. And some of it does. But without a strong guild, more of the revenue would go towards things like lavish "company" parties, hiring friends and cronies to give advice for huge amounts of money, and allowing "managers" to fire people over the tone of their voice. There are tradeoffs. When I worked at a startup, I would sometimes put in 70 or 80 hours a week. This meant a few dollars more to me each week and overall success for the company. The CTO bought a 15 million dollar house. Things were great for those at the top. The rest trickled down. But who's to say that the head of the company deserved a salary 5, 10, 25, 100x what everyone else was earning? We all work hard. We all have different skills. Being part of the guild ensures that you get your FAIR share.
