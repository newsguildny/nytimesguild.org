## The New York Times is union-made

Since 1940, the editorial and business workers of The New York Times have protected and advanced the interests of its members at The Times through the Times Guild.

While The New York Times continues to lead the media industry with critical and revolutionary journalism, we remind management that without us, there is no news, no platform, and no revenue.

Our member-led union, represented by the NewsGuild of New York, is continually working to build our collective strength. Through the union we gain flexibility, stability, and improved work-life balance. We buttress our job security and career growth. We stand up for fairness and accountability on management’s part. And we fight for a workplace that values, encourages, and promotes diversity and inclusion.

We have reached a monumental point in the history of The Times — one that our union can and will have a direct hand in shaping. As the existing union bargains our next contract, we will hold management accountable to their promises of a more diverse Times.

But we are only half the story. Once there was a union for almost every step in the process of  producing a newspaper: typesetters, pressmen, compositors, proofreaders. They gradually disappeared as the means of production, distribution and even newsgathering evolved and digitized.

Now, stronger than we have ever been, we are excited to welcome a new unit of tech workers into our Guild. Together we will ensure that The Times remains the leading storyteller on the planet, and that the company raises the bar for salaries, benefits, job security, paid time off, remote work options, and more.
