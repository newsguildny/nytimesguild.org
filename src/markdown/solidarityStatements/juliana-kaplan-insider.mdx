Being a Guild member and unionizing is without a doubt one of the best things I’ve ever done. Having status quo in place as we negotiate our first contract has meant we can ensure our members are getting paid equitably, protect their jobs, and even prevent layoffs. It’s been incredibly empowering and powerful for our shop.
