Our management can be ... chaotic. Forming our union really helped us create a culture where union members can help each other. We stand by each other, we have each other's backs when things get tough, we don't feel alone or like we have to look to management for support. When you think about union, don't just think of the contract - think about how it's a whole system where workers can lean on each other.
