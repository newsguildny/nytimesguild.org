## FAQ

<FAQ>
  <FAQItem question="What is a &quot;union&quot;?">
    <p>A union is a group of workers who organize to better their lives and collectively bargain with their employer. <strong>Collective bargaining</strong> is a process where employees appoint worker representatives to negotiate with management on a contract that sets standards for the entire workplace. Collective bargaining agreements typically run for three years and are legally enforceable contracts that guarantee employees certain rights, benefits and minimum pay.</p>
<p>Once we win recognition of our union, any disciplinary actions or changes that the company wants to make to working conditions—for example, changes to our promotion system or ability to work remotely—must be negotiated with us, the union. We also start negotiations with our current conditions as the baseline.</p>
