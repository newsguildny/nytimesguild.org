Like most of my colleagues, I love working at The Times. Itâ€™s full of intelligent, compassionate people who are all striving towards creating a more informed and just society. The goal of this union is not to divide but to democratize the workplace, one of the least democratic spaces of American life. Our hope is to have a seat at the table to make an already incredible place to work even better, and to be an example of what organized labor can bring to tech workers everywhere.
