I could talk a lot about how being a guild member has benefitted me personally â€” how Guild members have had my back in advocating for increased parental leave; how their tireless work around salary transparency helped me know my own worth; how they offered me protection and support when I felt it necessary to publicly criticize my working conditions. But truthfully, the thing about being a union member that makes me proudest is that its benefits are never just personal. I love being a union member because of the solidarity it builds between me and my colleagues. I love it because it empowers me to advocate to lift up others, not just myself. I love it because it has given me the framework to build community with workers across my industry, to fight for better conditions for some of the most mistreated and exploited workers in media, and to see other media workers as allies instead of competitors. This is what has made Guild membership among the most meaningful experiences of my life, and I truly hope that everyone has the opportunity to share in that feeling!
