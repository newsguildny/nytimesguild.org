As one of many who cares about the company’s mission, I feel we have an obligation to one another—and even to the company itself—to make sure its short-term business interests are being counterbalanced by a wider range of views represented in its decision making. I’m incredibly proud of my colleagues and thrilled to join the push for more equitable and sustainable outcomes.
