There is no feeling better than standing shoulder-to-shoulder with your colleagues and demanding what you deserve. There were lots of times when The New Yorker management told us something was impossible or that they wouldn't budge on something. Seeing our collective power turn the impossible into possible filled me with so much hope and optimism for the future. It's hard, it really is, but the reward of building a better workplace for the people around you is unbeatable. Seeing colleagues who have been grossly underpaid for years and years getting the salary they deserve is amazing. Being able to put just cause protection into place makes me feel so much more comfortable and safe at work when dealing with problem managers. As Conde tries to push us back to the office, I feel so much support and safety knowing that our entire shop will demand a say in that process. It's easy to feel powerless at work â€” that's what they want you to feel. This is how we get the power back. Together.
