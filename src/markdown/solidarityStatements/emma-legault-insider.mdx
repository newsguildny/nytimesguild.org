Through organizing, I've seen my colleagues coalesce around the radical idea that our newsroom should empower and support us. Since our certification last year, we've only continued to build our power. Knowing that we're one part of a formidable movement in the NewsGuild of New York inspires me to keep fighting for this vision at the bargaining table and beyond. Solidarity with the Times Tech Guild â€” can't wait to celebrate your election win and see what else you accomplish together!
