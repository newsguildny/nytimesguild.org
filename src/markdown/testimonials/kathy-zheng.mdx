I love working at The New York Times and Iâ€™m excited to form this union with
my colleagues! We all care so much about our journalistic mission and work
very hard to deliver the news to our readers. Tech workers getting a seat at
the table and adding our voice to decision making around our products and
policies will only make our work and our organization stronger!
